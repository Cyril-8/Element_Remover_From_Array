# Element_Remover_From_Array
This is a program that takes an array of integers from the user and allows them to remove one or more element.
This is my first project in C++ and I am proud of it.


Instead of using all the header files, you can just delete them and remove the // before #include <bits/stdc++.h>
This header includes all of C++ libraries and works perfectly with me (I use Dev++) That said, some compilers just don't accept it, so keep it like that just in case.
I tried to make code as clean as I can, and I add comments to make it even more readable.


Bye :)
